Title:  Getting Started Videos

Learn to use Apache Flex with the following video tutorials, created by our contributors and developers in Flex community.

Some of these videos were created for Adobe Flex, the predecessor to Apache Flex before it was donated to Apache. You may need to follow some additional steps in order to use some of the new features that Apache Flex provides. Find out more on the [Getting Started][1] page.  If you've made a video or tutorial that you would like featured here, let us know on the [mailing list][2].
