The Panel has a basic layout by default, which means it lays out elements within the panel by 
their individual constraints. You can specify a different layout to use within the panel such 
as shown in the inner panels (basic, horizontal and vertical layout panels. In that case the 
individual constraints on the Text items are ignored, as shown here."/>
