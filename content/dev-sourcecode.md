Title:  Source Code

We use [Git][1] for version control. You can [browse our repository][2] in your web browser. The development of the Flex SDK is done on branches and merged on 'develop' branch, while release candidates are done on the 'release' branch and merged to the 'master' for the production releases, see [A successful Git branching model][9] for more details.

For further information see the [Git Tutorials & Training][3] page.  Committers need to [properly configure][7] their git client and know the [Suggested Practices][8].
