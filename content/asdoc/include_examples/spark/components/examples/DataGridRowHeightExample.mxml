Demonstrate the DataGrid variableRowHeight and rowHeight properties. 

When variableRowHeight="false" (the default) use the slider to change the row height 
of all the DataGrid's rows. When variableRowHeight="true", each row's height is computed.  
With the variableRowHeight checkbox checked, try adding enough text to a string in the 
"name" column to cause the renderer to wrap, or resize the column's width by dragging 
the header's column separators.


By default all of the rows in a DataGrid have the same height.  The rows' heights are
defined by the rowHeight property and if its value is not specified, the computed "preferred" 
height of the first row is used.   If the variableRowHeight property is set to true,
then the height of each row is the maximum measured height of each cell that's been exposed,
so far.  That means that when the DataGrid's columns aren't all visible and variableRowHeight="true", 
scrolling new columns into view can cause a row's height to grow.   Similarly, the DataGrid
uses the first row's height (or the rendered height of the "typicalItem", if it was specified)
as an estimate for the heights of rows that haven't been scrolled into view yet.   This means
that the DataGrid Grid's contentHeight, i.e. total height of all of the rows, can grow or even 
shrink as it's scrolled, when variableRowHeight=true.  Since the scrollbar's thumb size reflects
the content size, you may see its height change a little as you scroll, although as the number
of rows gets large, this effect usually isn't noticeable.

The runtime support for variable height rows requires quite a bit more bookkeeping than the 
variableRowHeight="false" case and there's a commensurate impact on performance and footprint.
That's why by default the DataGrid is configured for fixed height rows.   That said, item
renderer complexity tends have a much bigger impact on display/scrolling performance, so 
developers need not shy away from specifying variableRowHeight=true, even when optimizing for
performance.
