The Apache FlexÂ® FalconJX Compiler has some compile-time and run-time dependencies.  Please make sure to review the dependencies section if you plan on re-compiling the source from scratch.

**Please review the release notes before installing or compiling this testing suite.**

<div class="headline"><h4>Current Release (0.7.0)</h4></div>

The Apache Flex team is pleased to offer this release, available as of the 07 September 2016.  It is considered to be 'beat' quality.  The purpose of this release is to gather feedback about the features and implementation strategies, and recruit new contributors as we grow these code bases into an SDK and tool chain that delivers the highest productivity developing applications that can run in the most places.   These releases may not handle production needs.  Expect lots of bugs and missing features.

Binaries are provided as a convenience for those who do not wish to compile FalconJX themselves.  The 0.7.0 binaries were published on the 07 September 2016.

**Please be aware of the dependencies listed in the section below.**  They are required in order to use the Apache Flex FalconJX Compiler.  The [README][15] explains these requirements further.

#### Verify the integrity of the files

Apache relies on 3rd party mirrors to distribute their software.  Because these releases are hosted on servers that are not under our control, we strongly recommend that you verify the integrity of the binaries or source code before you install it using the PGP or MD5 signatures listed next to the downloads.  This involves a few extra steps, but it will verify that you are getting a true Apache release.

The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the [KEYS][10] as well as the asc signature file for the relevant distribution. Make sure you get these files as linked from this page (rather than a mirror) to insure the integrity of the files.

    % pgpk -a KEYS

    % pgpv apache-flex-falconjx-0.7.0-src.tar.gz.asc

*or*

    % pgp -ka KEYS

    % pgp apache-flex-falconjx-0.7.0-src.tar.gz.asc

*or*

    % gpg --import KEYS

    % gpg --verify apache-flex-falconjx-0.7.0-src.tar.gz.asc


Alternatively, you can verify the MD5 signature on the files. A unix/Mac program called `md5` or `md5sum` is included in many unix distributions. It is also available as part of [GNU Textutils][11]. Windows users can get binary md5 programs from [here][12] , [here][13] , or [here][14]. An MD5 signature consists of 32 hex characters, and a SHA1 signature consists of 40 hex characters. Ensure your generated signature string matches the signature string published in the files above.
