      <p>You might encounter some versioning issues when working
on  Flex applications. When compiling, you
can choose the version of the SDK to use and you can target specific
versions of Adobe<sup>®</sup> Flash<sup>®</sup> Player.
You can replicate behavior of previous SDK versions. Also, you can
design applications that can load modules and other SWF files that
were compiled with different SDKs.</p>

   </div>

   <div class="nested1" id="WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf61e50-7ffd_verapache"><a name="WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf61e50-7ffd_verapache"><!-- --></a>
      <h2 class="topictitle2">Overview of versioning</h2>

      
      <div>
         <p>When a new version of Flex is released, it usually includes
changes to the APIs and compiler. As a result, if you were working
on a project but then upgraded your version of the SDK, you might
have to refactor some part of your code to be compatible with the
new version. In addition, if the audience for your application is
restricted in which version of Flash Player it can use, you might
have to make certain concessions to ensure that your application
runs without errors.</p>

         <p>
            <strong>Maintain older look and feel</strong>
         </p>

         <p>The differences between some versions of Flex go beyond new features.
The layout schemes and the styles of many components might have
changed from one version to the next. If you want to use new Flex
features but have your application look and feel the same as an
older version of Flex, you can specify the version whose styles
you want to use with the <samp class="codeph">compatibility-version</samp> compiler
option. For more information, see <a href="flx_versioning_ve.html#WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7ede_verapache">Backward
compatibility</a>.</p>

         <p>
            <strong>Target specific Player versions</strong>
         </p>

         <p>With current Flex tools, you can target your application toward
a specific version of Flash Player. To do this, you use the <samp class="codeph">target-player</samp> compiler
option. This is not the same as targeting an application to a specific <em>SWF version</em>.
For more information, see <a href="flx_versioning_ve.html#WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7ee0_verapache">Targeting
Flash Player versions</a>. </p>

         <p>
            <strong>Ensure sub-applications and applications work together</strong>
         </p>

         <p>If you want to load a sub-application into a main application
that was compiled with a different version of the compiler, you
can use the <samp class="codeph">loadForCompatibility</samp> property of the
SWFLoader control. Setting this property ensures that each SWF file
contains its own definitions of the linked classes, removing reliance
on particular APIs that might have changed between versions. You
can only use this property when the main application and sub-application
were compiled with version 3.2 of the Flex framework or later. In addition,
the main application must be compiled with a more recent or the
same version of the compiler as the sub-applications. For more information,
see <a href="flx_loading_applications_la.html#WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7f0c_verapache">Developing
multi-versioned applications</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="topictitle2">Backward compatibility</h2>

      
      <div>
         <p>To specify the version of the Flex compiler and framework
that the output should be compatible with, use the <samp class="codeph">compatibility-version</samp> compiler
option. Possible values for this compiler option are defined as
constants in the <a href="https://flex.apache.org/asdoc/mx/core/FlexVersion.html" target="_blank">FlexVersion</a> class. This option
affects some behavior such as the theme, layout rules, padding and
gaps, skins, and other style settings. In addition, it affects the rules
for parsing properties files.</p>

         <p>If you do not explicitly set the value of the <samp class="codeph">compatibility-version</samp> option, the
compiler defaults to the current SDK's version. </p>

         <p>For the command-line compilers, you can either pass the <samp class="codeph">compatibility-version</samp> compiler
option on the command line or set the value in the configuration
file. The following example sets the compatibility version to 4.0
in the flex-config.xml file:</p>

         <pre class="codeblock"> &lt;compiler&gt; 
 	&lt;mxml&gt; 
 		&lt;compatibility-version&gt;4.0&lt;/compatibility-version&gt; 
 	&lt;mxml&gt; 
 &lt;compiler&gt;</pre>

         <p>When you set the <samp class="codeph">compatibility-version</samp> option,
you must be sure that the configuration files that you use are compatible
with the version you select. </p>

         <p>You can programmatically access the version of the application
that you are running by using the <a href="https://flex.apache.org/asdoc/mx/core/FlexVersion.html" target="_blank">FlexVersion</a> class.
To get the current compatibility version in your application, use
the <samp class="codeph">compatibilityVersionString</samp> property of that class.
This lets you conditionalize the logic in your application based
on the compatibility version.</p>

         <h3 class="topictitle3">Using themes with compatibility-version</h3>

         
         <div>
            <p>When you set the compatibility version, you should also
be sure to use the appropriate theme file that matches that version.
Themes are located in the frameworks/themes directory. For Flex
4.x, you do not have to specify a theme file. The default Spark
theme file is designed for Flex 4.x compatibility. However, if you want
the Flex 3 look and feel, you must specify the Halo theme or another
theme that is compatible with the Flex 3 SDK. </p>

            <div class="p">The following command-line example uses the Halo theme and sets <samp class="codeph">compatibility-version</samp> to
3.0.0:<pre class="codeblock">mxmlc -compatibility-version=3.0.0 -theme=..\frameworks\themes\Halo\halo.swc MyApp.mxml</pre>

            </div>

            <p>For more information on using themes, see <a href="flx_styles_st.html#WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7f85_verapache">About
themes</a>. </p>

            <p>The default style sheets for several versions of Flex are available
in the framework.swc file. This SWC file contains the current default
style sheet (defaults.css) and the Flex 3 default style sheet (defaults-3.0.0.css).
The compiler uses the style sheet that is appropriate for the compatibility
version you set. For example, if you set the <samp class="codeph">compatibility-version</samp> option
to 3.0, then the compiler uses the Flex 3 default style sheet.</p>

         <h3 class="topictitle3">Differences between SDK 3 and SDK
4.x</h3>

         
         <div>
            <p>The differences between SDK 3 and SDK 4.x that result from
setting the <samp class="codeph">compatibility-version</samp> option include
fonts, skins, and styles. </p>

            <p>If you set <samp class="codeph">compatibility-version</samp> to 3.0.0, differences
include:</p>

            <div class="p">
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <p>The value of <samp class="codeph">embedAsCFF</samp> defaults
to <samp class="codeph">false</samp>. This means that non-CFF fonts are embedded,
rather than CFF fonts. For more information, see <a href="flx_fonts_ft.html#WS0FA8AEDB-C69F-4f19-ADA5-AA5757217624_verapache">Embedding fonts
with MX components</a>.</p>

                  </li>

                  <li>
                     <p>The Halo theme should be used to define the look and feel
of your application. This includes styles and skins.</p>

                  </li>

                  <li>
                     <p>Bi-directional binding will not work.</p>

      <h2 class="topictitle2">Targeting Flash Player versions</h2>

      
      <div>
         <p>Use the <samp class="codeph">target-player</samp> compiler option
to specify the version of Flash Player that you want to target with
the application. Features requiring a later version of Flash Player
are not compiled into the application.</p>

         <p>One reason for setting the target Player version is if you are
unsure of Player usage penetration rates and want to choose a Player
version that is lower than the most recent one. Another reason is
if your users are locked in to a particular Player version, such
as when they are on an intranet and cannot upgrade.</p>

         <p>The <samp class="codeph">target-player</samp> option has the following syntax:</p>

         <pre class="codeblock"> -target-player=<em>major_version</em>.<em>minor_version</em>.<em>revision</em></pre>

         <p>The <em>major_version</em> is required while <em>minor_version</em> and <em>revision</em> are
optional. If you do not specify the <em>minor_version</em> or <em>revision</em>,
the compiler uses zero. </p>

         <p>For Flex 4.0, the only supported value of the <samp class="codeph">target-player</samp> option
is 10.0.0. For Flex 4.1, the default value is 10.1.0. For Flex 4.5,
the default value is 10.2.0. For Flex 4.6, the default value is
11.1.</p>

         <p>The minimum value for Flex 4.6 is 11.1. The minimum value for
Flex 4.5 is 10.2.0. For Flex 4.0 and 4.1, the minimum value is 10.0.0
(although Flex 4.1 included Player 10.1). </p>

         <p>If you do not explicitly set the value of this option, the compiler
uses the default from the flex-config.xml file.</p>

         <p>
            <strong>SWF version (advanced)</strong>
         </p>

         <p>The <samp class="codeph">swf-version</samp> compiler option specifies the
SWF file format version of the output SWF file. Features requiring
a later version of the SWF file format are not compiled into the
application. This is different from the Player version in that it refers
to the SWF specification versioning scheme. </p>

         <div class="p">For example, to compile an application to version 10 of the SWF
specification, use the following:<pre class="codeblock">-swf-version=10</pre>

         </div>

         <p>This is an advanced option that you should only use if you have
an understanding of the SWF specification that you are targeting.

Technology Center</a>.</p>
