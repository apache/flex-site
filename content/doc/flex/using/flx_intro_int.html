      <p>Flex is a powerful, open source, front-end application framework that
         allows developers to easily create apps for both desktop and mobile
         using the same programming model, tools, and codebase. Developers may
         use Flex to build natively installed apps targeting iOS™, Android™, and
         BlackBerry® Tablet OS devices on mobile, or they can deploy traditional
         desktop applications on Windows®, macOS®, and Linux.</p>
      
      <p>In the past, Flex applications were also deployed to web browsers using
         Adobe Flash Player. While browser deployment is no longer possible with
         Flex because Adobe discontinued its browser plugin in 2020, developers
         may continue to package Flex applications as native apps using the AIR
         SDK. Adobe has officially licensed the AIR SDK to HARMAN for continued
         development, and it is frequently updated to remain compatible with the
         latest operating system changes.</p>
      
      <p>Developers build Flex applications using ActionScript and MXML.
         ActionScript is an object-oriented programming language that was
         created as superset of the ECMAScript standard (more widely known as
         JavaScript), with a stronger focus on classes, interfaces, and strong
         typing. MXML is a declarative markup language for laying out
         custom user interface components with powerful built-in features, like
         state management and data binding. Together, ActionScript and MXML
         provide developers with increased productivity and reduced cognitive
         load by separating concerns and eliminating redundant boilerplate.</p>

      <p>Dozens of built-in user interface components (from buttons, sliders,
         lists, grids, drop-downs, and a variety of layout containers) make it
         easy to create many types of forms, dashboards, and visualizations.
         Developers can create high-level components with MXML to set properties
         and styles, listen for events, configure layouts, bind to data sources
         to automatically update views when the data changes, and use states to
         dynamically hide and show content. Flex also provides hooks into its
         lower-level component lifecycle that may be accessed from ActionScript
         to build completely new components that go beyond what Flex's built-in
         libraries provide out of the box, allowing developers to take full
         advantage of every graphical capability provided by Flash Player and
         AIR.</p>

      <p>Flex offers a variety of visual customization options for its UI
         components, including styling with CSS or replacing their default
         appearance with completely custom skins created by a designer. Styles
         include fonts (both from those installed on the user's device and by
         embedding custom fonts), colors, borders, paddings, gaps, and other
         spacing. Skins may be created from both bitmap and vector graphics,
         imported from a variety of design tools. Similarly, developers may use
         built-in animations and transitions to delight users and guide them
         through complex navigations within the app. All motion is fully
         configurable, to allow it to be as flashy or understated as
         desired.</p>

      <p>Usability features include data validation (to display helpful errors
         for users and prevent forms from being submitted until the issues are
         fixed), formatting numbers, currency, and other data strings,
         localization to display different strings in the application based on
         the user's language and region, displaying pop-up floating dialogs and
         modals that prevent mouse, touch, and keyboard access below until
         dismissed, drag-and-drop to move items within and between data-based
         controls, and accessibility hooks for screen readers and other
         assistive tooling.</p>

      <p>Flex supports a variety of build, testing, and deployment tools. The
         Flex SDK includes powerful command line compilers, and a variety of
         editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) either include
         built-in Flex projects or well-supported third-party plugins for
         Flex that can build Flex applications directly in the editor. FlexUnit
         provides unit and integration testing, and Flex also supports powerful
         enterprise automation tools for functional testing of user
         interactions. For deployment, Flex apps can be distributed as native
         apps in platform-specific app stores, or using downloadable installers.</p>

      <p>This manual brings together all of the features mentioned above into a
         single guide, to teach developers how to develop applications with
         Flex. Start by learning the ActionScript and MXML languages. Then, gain
         an understanding how to of compose the built-in UI components with
         layouts, states, and data binding to create powerful forms, dashboards,
         or data visualizations. Style and skin your Flex app to customize its
         appearance to match your brand's guidelines, integrating your workflow
         with a designer. Enhance usability with powerful features like
         validation, formatting, and drag-and-drop. Finally, create a release
         build, run tests, and deploy your app to your users.</p>
