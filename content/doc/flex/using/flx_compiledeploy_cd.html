   <div>
      <p>When you compile an application, you create a SWF file
that a user can download and play. You can also compile any custom
components that you create as part of the application.</p>

      <p>When you create a component, you save it to a location that the
 Flex compiler can access. You can save your
components as MXML and ActionScript files, as SWC files, or as Runtime
Shared Libraries (RSLs). You have several options when you compile
the components.</p>

         <div>
            <p>
               Flex includes
two compilers: mxmlc and compc. You use the mxmlc compiler to compile
MXML, ActionScript, SWC, and RSL files into a single SWF file. After
your application is compiled and deployed on your web or application
server, a user can make an HTTP request to download and play the
SWF file on their computer. </p>

            <p>
               You use the compc
compiler to compile components, classes, and other files into SWC
files or into RSLs. </p>

            <p>You use the compc and mxmlc compilers from a command line. For
more information on using the compilers, see <a href="flx_compilers_cpl.html#WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7ffd_verapache">Flex
compilers</a>.</p>

            <p>The most basic example of using the mxmlc compiler is one in
which the MXML file has no external dependencies (such as components
in a SWC file or ActionScript classes). In this case, you open mxmlc
and point it to your MXML file:</p>

            <pre class="codeblock"> $ mxmlc c:/myfiles/app.mxml</pre>

            <p>The default option is the target file to compile into a SWF file,
and it must have a value. If you use a space-separated list as part
of the options, you can terminate the list with a double hyphen
before adding the target file, as in the following example:</p>

            <pre class="codeblock"> $ mxmlc -option arg1 arg2 arg3 -- target_file.mxml</pre>

compilation</h3>

         
         <div>
            <p>The Flex compilers use a case-sensitive file lookup on
all file systems. On case-insensitive file systems, such as the
Macintosh and Windows file systems, the Flex compiler generates
a case-mismatch error when you use a component with the incorrect
case. On case-sensitive file systems, such as the UNIX file system,
the Flex compiler generates a component-not-found error when you
use a component with the incorrect case. </p>

         <h3 class="topictitle3">About the ActionScript source path</h3>

         
         <div>
            <p>
               
               Typically,
you put component files in directories that are in the ActionScript source
path. These include your application’s root directory, its subdirectories, and
any directory that you specify to the compiler. To specify a directory,
you use the <samp class="codeph">source-path</samp> option to the mxmlc compiler. </p>

            <p>The following rules can help you organize your custom components:</p>

            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>An application can access MXML and ActionScript components
in the same directory and in its subdirectories. </p>

               </li>

               <li>
                  <p>An ActionScript component in a subdirectory of the main application directory
must define a fully qualified package name that is relative to the location
of the application’s root directory. For example, if you define
a custom component in the dir1/dir2/myControls/PieChart.as file,
its fully qualified package name must be dir1.dir2.myControls, assuming
dir1 is an immediate subdirectory of the main application directory.</p>

               </li>

               <li>
                  <p>An MXML component does not include a package name definition.
However, you must declare a namespace definition in the file that
references the MXML component that corresponds to the directory
location of the MXML component, either in a subdirectory of the
application’s root directory or in a subdirectory of the source
path. For more information, see <a href="flx_mxmlcomponents_mxc.html#WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7feb_verapache">Simple
MXML components</a>.</p>

               </li>

               <li>
                  <p>An application can access MXML and ActionScript components
in the directories included in the ActionScript source path. The
component search order in the source path is based on the order
of the directories listed in the source path.</p>

               </li>

               <li>
                  <p>An ActionScript component in a subdirectory of a directory
included in the source path must define a fully qualified package
name that is relative to the location of the source path directory.
For example, if you define a custom component in the file dir1/dir2/myControls/PieChart.as,
and dir1 is included in the ActionScript source path, its fully
qualified package name must be dir1.dir2.myControls.</p>

               </li>

               <li>
                  <p>The <samp class="codeph">&lt;fx:Script&gt;</samp> tag in the main MXML
file, and in dependent MXML component files, can reference components
located in the ActionScript source path.</p>

SDK</h2>

      
      <div>
         <p>How you compile an application with the Flex SDK is based
on how you distribute your custom components that are distributed
as MXML, ActionScript, SWC, and RSL files. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="nested2" id="WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf68391-7ff9_verapache"><a name="WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf68391-7ff9_verapache"><!-- --></a>
         <h3 class="topictitle3">Distributing components as MXML
and ActionScript files</h3>

         
         <div>
            <p>When you compile an application with Flex SDK, you define
where the MXML and ActionScript files for your custom components
exist in the directory structure of your application, or in the
directory structure of components shared by multiple applications. </p>

            <p>For example, you can create a component for use by a single application.
In that case, you store it in the directory structure of the application,
usually in a subdirectory under the directory that contains the
main file of the application. The component is then compiled with
the entire application into the resultant SWF file.</p>

            <p>You can also create a component that is shared among multiple
applications as an MXML or ActionScript file. In that case, store
the component in a location that is included in the ActionScript
source path of the application. When Flex compiles the application,
it also compiles the components included in the application’s ActionScript
source path.</p>

            <p>You specify the directory location of the shared components by
using the following method:</p>

            <dl>
               
                  <dt class="dlterm">mxmlc compiler</dt>

                  <dd>
                     <p>Use the <samp class="codeph">source-path</samp> option to the mxmlc
compiler to specify the directory location of your shared MXML and
ActionScript files. </p>

                  </dd>

               
            </dl>

         </div>

      <div class="nested2" id="WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf68391-7ff8_verapache"><a name="WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf68391-7ff8_verapache"><!-- --></a>
         <h3 class="topictitle3">Distributing components as SWC
files</h3>

         
         <div>
            <p>A SWC file is an archive file of Flex components. SWC files
make it easy to exchange components among Flex developers. You need
to exchange only a single file, rather than the MXML or ActionScript
files, images, and other resource files. In addition, the SWF file
inside a SWC file is compiled, which means that the code is hidden
from casual view. Finally, compiling a component as a SWC file can make
namespace allocation an easier process.</p>

            <p>
               SWC
files can contain one or more components and are packaged and expanded with
the PKZIP archive format. You can open and examine a SWC file by
using WinZip, JAR, or another archiving tool. However, do not manually
change the contents of a SWC file, and do not try to run the SWF
file that is in a SWC file outside of the SWC file.</p>

            <p>When you compile your application, you specify the directory
location of the SWC files by using the following method:</p>

            <dl>
               
                  <dt class="dlterm">mxmlc compiler</dt>

                  <dd>
                     <p>Set the <samp class="codeph">library-classpath</samp> option to the
mxmlc compiler to specify the directory location of your SWC files. </p>

                     <p>One
of the advantages of distributing components as SWC files is that
you can define a global style sheet, named defaults.css, in the
SWC file. The defaults.css file defines the default style settings
for all of the components defined in the SWC file. For more information,
see <a href="flx_mxmlcomponents_mxc.html#WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7a00_verapache">Applying

            <p>
               
               
               One way to reduce the size of your application’s
SWF file is by externalizing shared assets into stand-alone files
that can be separately downloaded and cached on the client. These
shared assets are loaded by any number of applications at run time,
but must be transferred to the client only once. These shared files
are known as Runtime Shared Libraries (RSLs).</p>

            <p>If you have multiple applications but those applications share
a core set of components or classes, your users download those assets
only once as an RSL. The applications that share the assets in the
RSL use the same cached RSL as the source for the libraries as long
as they are in the same domain. By using an RSL, you can reduce
the resulting file size for your applications. The benefits increase as
the number of applications that use the RSL increases. If you only
have one application, putting components into RSLs does not reduce
the aggregate download size, and may increase it.</p>

            <p>When you compile your application, you specify the directory
location of an RSL file by using the following method:</p>

            <dl>

         <h3 class="topictitle3">Example: Compiling a custom formatter
component</h3>

         
         <div>
            <p>The example in this section uses a custom formatter component
that is defined as an ActionScript file. The name of the formatter
is MySimpleFormatter, and it is defined in the file MySimpleFormatter.as.
For more information on creating customer formatter components,
see <a href="flx_createformatters_cf.html#WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7a04_verapache">Custom
formatters</a>. </p>

            <p>The process for compiling an MXML file is the same as for an
ActionScript file. For an example of deploying an MXML file, see <a href="flx_mxmlcomponents_mxc.html#WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7feb_verapache">Simple

            <h4 class="topictitle4">Distributing a component as an
ActionScript file</h4>

            
            <div>
               <p>
                  When
you distribute a component defined as an ActionScript file, you
can store it within the same directory structure as your application
files or in a directory specified in the ActionScript source path.</p>

               <p>The MXML tag name for a custom component consists of two parts:
the namespace prefix and the tag name. The namespace prefix tells
Flex where to look for the file that implements the custom component.
The tag name corresponds to the filename of the component, in this
case MySimpleFormatter.as. Therefore, the file MySimpleFormatter.as
defines a component with the tag name of <samp class="codeph">&lt;</samp>
                  <em>namespace</em>
                  <samp class="codeph">:MySimpleFormatter&gt;</samp>.</p>

               <p>The main application MXML file defines the namespace prefix used
to reference the component in the <samp class="codeph">&lt;s:Application&gt;</samp> tag.
When you deploy your formatter as an ActionScript file, you refer
to it in one of the following ways:</p>

               <ol>
                  <li>
                     <p>If you store the formatter component in the same directory
as the application file, or in a directory that the ActionScript
source path (not a subdirectory) specifies, you define the formatter
by using an empty <samp class="codeph">package</samp> statement, as the following
example shows:</p>

                     <pre class="codeblock"> package 
 { 
 	//Import base Formatter class. 
 	import mx.formatters.Formatter 
  
 	public class MySimpleFormatter extends Formatter { 
 		... 
 	} 
 }</pre>

                     <p>You can refer to it as the following example shows.
In the following code, the local namespace (*) is mapped to the
prefix MyComp.</p>

                     <pre class="codeblock"> &lt;s:Application xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009" 
	xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark" 
	xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx" 
 	xmlns:MyComp="*"&gt; 
  
 	<strong>&lt;MyComp:MySimpleFormatter/&gt;</strong> 
  
 &lt;/s:Application&gt;</pre>

                     <p>If the same file exists in
the ActionScript source path directory and the application directory,
Flex uses the file in the application directory.</p>

                  </li>

                  <li>
                     <p>If you store the formatter component in a subdirectory of
the directory that contains the application file, you specify that
directory as part of the <samp class="codeph">package</samp> statement, as
the following example shows:</p>

                     <pre class="codeblock"> <strong>package myComponents.formatters</strong> 
 { 
 	//Import base Formatter class 
 	import mx.formatters.Formatter 
  
 	public class MySimpleFormatter extends Formatter { 
 		... 
 	} 
 }</pre>

                     <p>In this example, the MySimpleFormatter.as file
is located in the myComponents/formatter subdirectory of the main
application directory. You map the myComponents.formatters namespace
to the <samp class="codeph">MyComp</samp> prefix, as the following example
shows:</p>

                     <pre class="codeblock"> &lt;s:Application xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009" 
	xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark" 
	xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx" 
	xmlns:MyComp="myComponents.formatters.*"&gt; 
  
 	<strong>&lt;MyComp:MySimpleFormatter/&gt;</strong> 
  
 &lt;/s:Application&gt;</pre>

                     <p>If multiple files with the
same name exist under an ActionScript source path subdirectory and
the application subdirectory, Flex uses the file under the application
subdirectory.</p>

                  </li>

                  <li>
                     <p>If you store the formatter component in a subdirectory of
the ActionScript source path directory, you specify that subdirectory
as part of the <samp class="codeph">package</samp> statement, as the following
example shows: </p>

                     <pre class="codeblock"> <strong>package flexSharedRoot.custom.components</strong> 
 { 
 	//Import base Formatter class. 
 	import mx.formatters.Formatter 
  
 	public class MySimpleFormatter extends Formatter { 
 		... 
 	} 
 }</pre>

                     <p>You then use a namespace that specifies the subdirectory.
The following code declares a component that is in the flexSharedRoot/custom/components directory:</p>

                     <pre class="codeblock"> &lt;s:Application xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009" 
	xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark" 
	xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx" 
	 xmlns:MyComp="flexSharedRoot.custom.components.*"/&gt; 
  
 	<strong>&lt;MyComp:MySimpleFormatter/&gt;</strong> 
  
 &lt;/s:Application&gt;</pre>

                     <p>If the same file exists in
the ActionScript source path directory and the application directory,
Flex uses the file in the application file directory.</p>

                  </li>

               </ol>

            </div>

         </div>

         <div class="nested3" id="WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf68391-7ff4_verapache"><a name="WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf68391-7ff4_verapache"><!-- --></a>
            <h4 class="topictitle4">Distributing a component as a SWC
file</h4>

            
            <div>
               <p>To create a SWC file, use the compc compiler in the <em>flex_install_dir</em>/bin
directory. The compc compiler generates a SWC file from MXML component
source files and/or ActionScript component source files. </p>

               <p>In this example, you create a SWC file for a custom formatter
component that you defined by using the following package and class
definition:</p>

               <pre class="codeblock"> <strong>package myComponents.formatters</strong> 
 { 
 	//Import base Formatter class. 
 	import mx.formatters.Formatter 
  
 	public class MySimpleFormatter extends Formatter { 
 		... 
 	} 
 }</pre>

               <p>In this example, the MySimpleFormatter.as file is in the directory
c:\flex\myComponentsForSWCs\myComponents\formatters. </p>

               <p>You use the following compc command from the <em>flex_install_dir</em>/bin
directory to create the SWC file for this component:</p>

               <pre class="codeblock"> .\compc -source-path c:\flex\myComponentsForSWCs\ 
 	-include-classes myComponents.formatters.MySimpleFormatter 
 	-o c:\flex\mainApp\MyFormatterSWC.swc</pre>

               <p>In this example, you use the following options of the compc compiler:</p>

               
<div class="tablenoborder"><table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" frame="border" border="1" rules="all">

               <p>When you distribute SWC files, ensure that the corresponding
