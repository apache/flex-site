   <h1 class="topictitle1">Deploying applications</h1>

   <div>
      <p>When you deploy an application written in  Flex, you make the application accessible to
your users. The process of deploying an application is dependent
on your application, your application requirements, and your deployment
environment. For example, the process of deploying an application
on an internal website that is only accessible by company employees
might be different from the process for deploying the same application
on a public website accessible by anyone.</p>

      <p>Use the overview of the deployment process and the general checklist
as a guide when you deploy your application. This topic does not
attempt to define the exact set of steps that you use for deploying
all applications. Instead, it contains an overview of the deployment
process, and a general checklist that you might use when you deploy
your application. </p>

      <div>
         <p>
            
            When you deploy an application,
you move the application from your development environment to your
deployment environment. After you deploy it, customers have full
access to the application.</p>

         <p>The deployment process that your organization uses might only
require you to copy a application’s SWF file from your development
server to your deployment server. In many organizations however,
the deployment process is more complicated, and involves people
from groups outside the development organization. For example, you
might have an IT department that maintains your corporate website.
The IT department might be responsible for staging, testing, and
then deploying your application.</p>

         <p>Your application architecture might also require you to deploy
more than just a single SWF file. For example, your application
might access Runtime Shared Libraries (RSLs) or other assets at
run time. You must make sure to copy all required files to your
deployment environment. </p>

         <p>Deployment might also require you to perform operations other
than just copying application files to a deployment server. Your
application might access data services on your server, or on another
server. You must ensure that your data services are accessible by
a deployed Flex application that executes on a client’s computer. </p>

         <p>Deploying an application for Flex SDK might require you to perform
some or all of the following actions:</p>

         <ul>
            <li>
               <p>Copy the application SWF file to your deployment server.
As the previous example shows, you copy the application to webserver.example.com.</p>

            <li>
               <p>Copy any asset files, such as icons, media files, or other
assets, to your deployment server. </p>

               <p>A deployed SWF file

the SWF file directly, but request a web page that references the
SWF file. For more information, see <a href="flx_wrapper_wr.html#WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7ecf_verapache">Creating

         <div>
            <p>
               
               When
your application uses custom RSLs, you must make sure to deploy
the RSL on your deployment server, in the same domain, unless you
are using cross-domain RSLs. You use the <samp class="codeph">runtime-shared-libraries</samp> option
of the Flex compiler to specify the directory location of the RSL
at compile time. Ensure that you copy the RSL to the same directory
that you specified with <samp class="codeph">runtime-shared-libraries</samp>. </p>

            <p>By default, the Flex compilers dynamically link your application
against the framework RSLs. This means that classes in the SDK are
externally loaded at run time from the framework RSLs. The default
location of these RSLs is on the Adobe<sup>®</sup> web site. If you clients
do not have network connectivity, you must deploy the framework
RSLs to a local location, or disable framework RSLs. To customize
the location of framework RSLs, edit the flex-config.xml file. To
disable framework RSLs, set the <samp class="codeph">static-link-runtime-shared-libraries</samp> compiler option
to <samp class="codeph">true</samp>. </p>

            <p>Flex also provides framework RSLs. These libraries are comprised
of the Flex class libraries and can be used with any application
built with Flex. The framework RSLs are precompiled libraries of
framework classes and components. If your client does not have internet
connectivity, be sure to deploy both the signed (*.SWZ) and unsigned
(*.SWF) RSLs. Flash<sup>®</sup> Player will first try to load the signed RSLs
from the Adobe web site, so you should not have to deploy them in
most cases.</p>

         <h3 class="topictitle3">Deploying modules with Flex SDK</h3>

         
         <div>
            <p>Modules are SWF files that can be loaded and unloaded by
an application. They cannot be run independently of an application,
but any number of applications can share the modules. When your
application uses a module, you must make sure to deploy the module’s
SWF file on your deployment server in the same directory structure
as you used for your development environment. For more information,

         <h3 class="topictitle3">Deploying additional Flex files</h3>

         
         <div>
            <p>The implementation of some Flex features requires that
you deploy additional files along with your application’s SWF file.
For example, if you use deep linking functionality in your application,
you must deploy the historyFrame.html, history.css, and history.js
files. If you use the Express Install version detection feature,
you also must deploy the playerProductInstall.swf file with your
SWF file. You typically deploy these files in the same location
that the default HTML wrapper looks for them. For example, the deep
linking files are typically in a sub directory called /history. </p>

            <p>For a complete list of additional Flex files that you might deploy

         <h3 class="topictitle3">Accessing data services from a
deployed application</h3>

         
         <div>
            <p>
               In
a typical Flex development environment, you build and test your
application behind a corporate firewall, where security restrictions
are much less strict than when a customer runs the application on
their own computer. However, when you deploy the application, it
runs on a customers computer outside your firewall. That simple
change of location might cause the application to fail if you do
not correctly configure your data services to allow external access.</p>

            <p>Most run-time accesses to application resources fall into one
of the following categories:</p>

            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>Direct access to asset files on a web server, such as
image files. </p>

               </li>

               <li>
                  <p>Direct access to resources on your J2EE application server. </p>

               </li>

               <li>
                  <p>Data services requests through a proxy. A proxy redirects
that request to the server that handles the data service request. </p>

               </li>

               <li>
                  <p>Direct access to a data service. </p>

               </li>

            </ul>

            <p>As part of deploying your application, ensure that all run-time
data access requests work correctly from the application that is
executing outside of your firewall.</p>

               The
Flex accessibility option lets you create applications that are
accessible to users with disabilities. By default, accessibility
is disabled. You enable the accessibility features of Flex components
at compile time by setting the <samp class="codeph">accessible</samp> option
to <samp class="codeph">true</samp> for the command-line compiler, or setting
the <samp class="codeph">&lt;accessible&gt;</samp> tag in the flex-config.xml

               You
can use incremental compilation to decrease the time it takes to
compile an application or component library with the Flex application
compilers. When incremental compilation is enabled, the compiler

               A <em>headless server</em> is
one that is running UNIX or Linux and often does not have a monitor,
keyboard, mouse, or even a graphics card. Headless servers are most commonly
encountered in ISPs and ISVs, where available space is at a premium and
servers are often mounted in racks. Enabling the headless mode reduces
the graphics requirements of the underlying system and can allow
for a more efficient use of memory.</p>

            <p>If you deploy a Flex application on a headless server, you must
set the <samp class="codeph">headless-server</samp> option of the compiler

            <p>When deploying a Flex application, you must make sure you
also deploy all the assets that the application uses at run time.
These include files that are used by the wrapper to support features
such as deep linking and Express Install, as well as files that
are loaded by the application such as resource bundles or RSLs.</p>

            <p>Most of the deployment issues that customers report are related
to network security and routing, and fall into one of the following
scenarios:</p>

            <ol>
               <li>
                  <p>Direct access to resources on a web server, such as image
files. In the preceding example, the client directly accesses resources
on webserver.example.com.</p>

               </li>

               <li>
                  <p>Direct access to resources on your application server. In
the preceding example, the client directly accesses resources on
appserver.example.com. Ensure that deployed applications can access
the appropriate servers. </p>

               </li>

               <li>
                  <p>Web services requests through a proxy. A proxy redirects
a request to the server that handles the web service. In the preceding
example, the client accesses a resource on appserver.example.com,
but that request is redirected to finance.example.com. Ensure that
you configure the proxy server correctly so that deployed Flex applications
can access your web services, or other data services, through the
proxy. </p>

               <li>
                  <p>Direct access of a web service. In the preceding example,
the client directly accesses a service on finance.example.com. If
a deployed Flex application directly accesses web services, or other
data services, ensure that access is allowed. </p>

         <div>
            <p>
               In
some cases, an external request to one server can be redirected
to another server behind your firewall. A redirected request can
occur for a request to a web service or to any file, depending on
the system configuration. Where it is necessary, ensure that your
servers can communicate with each other so that a redirected request
can be properly handled. </p>

            <p>To determine if one server, called Server A in this example,
can communicate with another server, called Server B, create a temporary
file called temp.htm on Server A in its web root directory. Then,
log in to Server B and ensure that it can access temp.htm on Server
A. Try to access the file by using Server A’s DNS name and also
its IP address. </p>

            <p>Servers can have multiple NIC cards or multiple IP addresses.
Ensure that each server can communicate with all of the IP addresses
on your other servers.</p>

            <p>Also, log in to the server that hosts your web service proxy
to make sure that it can access all web services on all other servers.
You can test the web service proxy by making an HTTP request to
the WSDL file for each web service. In the previous example, log
in to appserver.example.com and ensure that it can access the WSDL
files on finance.example.com. </p>

            <p>If any server cannot access the other servers in your system,
an external request from a Flex application might also fail. For
more information, contact your system administrator. </p>

         <h3 class="topictitle3">Step 3. Verify access to your servers
from outside the firewall</h3>

         
         <div>
            <p>Some servers might have to be accessed from outside the
firewall to handle HTTP, SOAP, or AMF requests from clients. You
can use the following methods to determine if a deployed Flex application
can access your servers from outside the firewall:</p>

            <ol>
               <li>
                  <p>On each server that can be accessed from outside the
firewall, create a temporary file, such as temp.htm, on the server
in its web root directory. From a computer outside the firewall,
use a browser to make an HTTP request to the temporary file to ensure
that an external computer can access it. </p>

                  <p>For example, for
a file named temp.htm, try accessing it by using the following URL:</p>

                  <p>
                     <samp class="codeph">http://webserver.example.com/server1/temp.htm</samp>
                  </p>

               </li>

               <li>
                  <p>From a computer outside the firewall, use a browser to make
an HTTP request to the WSDL file for each web service that can be
accessed from outside the firewall to ensure that the WSDL file
can be accessed.</p>

                  <p>For example, try accessing the WSDL file
for a web service by using the following URL: </p>

                  <p>
                     <samp class="codeph">http://finance.example.com/server1/myWS.wsdl</samp>
                  </p>

               </li>

            </ol>

            <p>You should be able to access the temp.htm file or the WSDL file
on all of your servers from outside the firewall. If these requests
fail, contact your IT department to determine why the files cannot
be accessed. </p>

         <h3 class="topictitle3">Step 5. Create a crossdomain policy
file </h3>

         
         <div>
            <p>Your system might be configured to allow a Flex application
to directly access server-side resources on different domains or
different computers without going through a proxy. These operations
fail under the following conditions:</p>

            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>When the Flex application’s SWF file references a URL,
and that URL is outside the exact domain of the SWF file that makes
the request</p>

               </li>

               <li>
                  <p>When the Flex application’s SWF file references an HTTPS
URL, and the SWF file that makes the request is not served over
HTTPS</p>

               </li>

            </ul>

            <p>To make a data service or asset available to SWF files in different
domains or on different computers, use a crossdomain policy file
on the server that hosts the data service or asset. A <em>crossdomain policy file</em> is
an XML file that provides a way for the server to indicate that
its data services and assets are available to SWF files served from
certain domains, or from all domains. Any SWF file that is served from
a domain specified by the server’s policy file is permitted to access
a data service or asset from that server. By default, place the
crossdomain.xml at the root directory of the server that is serving
the data.</p>

            <p>For more information on using a cross-domain policy file, see <a href="flx_security2_se.html#WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7f2b_verapache">Using
