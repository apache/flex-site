  This is the accessibility implementation class for
  spark.components.DataGrid.
   <p>When a Spark DataGrid is created, its <code>focusOwner</code> child
  object's <code>accessibilityImplementation</code> property is set to an
  instance of this class. The accessibility implementation is placed on
  this placeholder <code>focusOwner</code> object so that the DataGrid's
  accessibility implementation does not obscure the item editor's
  accessibility implementation.  The DataGrid component itself does not
  have an accessibility implementation.  This step is required as the
  current version of the Flash Player does not support multiple levels of
  MSAA objects.  Item editors can be any component and need to be full MSAA
  objects.  The item editor objects appear as sibling objects to the
  DataGrid in the MSAA tree structure.  The accessibility implementation
  for each item editor is thus handled by the accessibility implementation
  associated with that component, such as <code>CheckBoxAccImpl</code> for
  a CheckBox.  The item editor's accessibility implementation only exists
  when there is an item editor session, and there can only be one item
  editor active at one time; thus, there is one or zero instances of the
  item editor accessibility implementation active at any time.</p>
               <p>Two methods are overwritten in the <code>DataGrid</code> class to
  properly handle focus among <code>DataGrid</code> and the
  <code>focusOwner</code> child of <code>DataGrid</code>.  The
  <code>GridItemRenderer</code> class turns accessibility off for item
  renderers, as by default these will be handled as simple objects under
  the DataGrid accessibility implementation.  While this limits how
  non-item editor components such as CheckBox, Panel, etc. can be used in
  DataGrids, it prevents these items from showing up as siblings to the
  DataGrid in the MSAA tree.  Allowing all grid item renderers to show up
  as siblings to the DataGrid in the MSAA tree would be very confusing to
  users of screen readers as there would be no context or relationship.
  Developers can of course override this default behavior if desired to
  display these renderers with accessibility enabled.</p>
               <p>The Flash Player then uses this class to allow MSAA clients such as
  screen readers to see and manipulate the DataGrid. See the
  mx.accessibility.AccImpl and
  flash.accessibility.AccessibilityImplementation classes for background
  information about accessibility implementation classes and MSAA.</p>
               <p>The <code>DataGridAccImpl</code> extends the
  <code>ListBaseAccImpl</code> (as the <code>DataGrid</code> extends the
  <code>DataGridBase</code> which extends the <code>ListBase</code> class).
  The Spark <code>DataGridAccImpl</code> is most similar to the MX
  <code>AdvancedDataGridAccImpl</code> as the AdvancedDataGrid also
  supports single cell and row selection which the MX DataGrid did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <b>Children</b>
               </p>
               <p>The MSAA children of a DataGrid are, in this order</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>One child for each visible header cell, starting from the left.
  "Visible" here means not hidden by the developer
  (<code>column.visible=false</code>).  The header for a column that is not
  marked invisible by the developer but which is scrolled off screen is
  considered "visible" here.</li>
                  <li>In row selection mode, one child for each data row in the grid; OR</li>
                  <li>In cell selection mode, one child for each cell in the grid,
  excluding cells in invisible (as just described) columns.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>The number of children depends on the number of rows and columns in
  the <code>dataProvider</code>, not on the number of items currently
  displayed on screen.</p>
               <p>Note that, unlike for <code>ListBase</code>, DataGrid child count does
  not reflect the number of data rows in the control.  Assistive technology
  should therefore avoid using <code>AccChildCount</code> as a means of
  reporting row count.</p>
               <p>This property is not handled by the DataGrid accessibility
  implementation for item editors as item editors manage themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <b>Role</b>
               </p>
               <p>The MSAA Role of a DataGrid is <code>ROLE_SYSTEM_LIST</code>.</p>
               <p>The Role of each data row or cell in the DataGrid is
  <code>ROLE_SYSTEM_LISTITEM</code>.</p>
               <p>The Role of each header cell in the DataGrid is
  <code>ROLE_SYSTEM_COLUMNHEADER</code>.</p>
               <p>This property is not handled by the DataGrid accessibility
  implementation for item editors as item editors manage themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <b>Name</b>
               </p>
               <p>The MSAA Name of a DataGrid is, by default, an empty string. When
  wrapped in a <code>FormItem</code> element, the Name is the FormItem's
  label. To override this behavior, set the DataGrids's
  <code>accessibilityName</code> property.  Setting the
  <code>accessibilityName</code> property will also apply the accessible
  name to the <code>focusOwner</code> child object of the DataGrid which
  represents the DataGrid.</p>
               <p>The Name of each data row (when in row selection mode) is a string of
  the form "_column1Name_: _column1Value_, _column2Name_: _column2Value_,
  ..., _columnNName_: _columnNValue_, Row _m_ of _n_."  Columns are
  separated from each other by commas, and column names and values are
  separated from each other by colons.  Columns hidden by the developer are
  omitted entirely from the Name string.  Example Name string: "Contact
  Name: Doug, Contact Phone: 555-1212, Contact Zip: 12345, row 3 of 7."</p>
               <p>Note that "Row _m_ of _n_" is localized.</p>
               <p>The Name of each data cell in column 1 (when in cell selection mode)
  is a string of the form "_columnName_: _columnValue_, Row _m_ of _n_."
  Example:  "Contact Phone: 555-1212, Row 2 of 5."  Subsequent columns use
  the same format but omit the "Row _m_ of _n_" portion.</p>
               <p>Note that "Row _m_ of _n_" is localized.</p>
               <p>The Name string for a column header (in cell or row selection mode) is
  normally the text of the header.  Example:  "Contact Phone."  If the grid
  is sorted by the corresponding column however, the string "sorted" or
  "sorted descending" is appended to the column name, to indicate the sort
  and its direction.  Example:  "Contact Name sorted."  For a multicolumn
  sort, level strings are also appended indicating each column's level in
  the set of sorting columns.  For example, if a grid is sorted first by
  column 3 and then by column 2, and column 2 is sorted in descending
  order, column 3's name will end with "Sorted Level 1," and column 2's
  name will end with "Sorted descending level 2."  The strings for
  indicating ascending sort, descending sort, and sort level are
  localized.</p>
               <p>When the Name of the DataGrid or one of its items changes, a DataGrid
  dispatches the MSAA event <code>EVENT_OBJECT_NAMECHANGE</code> with the
  proper childID for a row or cell or 0 for itself.</p>
               <p>If an accessibility name is not set for an item editor, one is set
  based on the column header name for the cell.</p>
               <p>
                  <b>Description</b>
               </p>
               <p>The MSAA Description of a DataGrid is, by default, an empty string,
  but you can set the DataGrid's <code>accessibilityDescription</code>
  property.</p>
               <p>The Description of each row, cell, or header is the empty string and
  can not be set by an AccImpl.</p>
               <p>This property is not handled by the DataGrid accessibility
  implementation for item editors as item editors manage themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <b>State</b>
               </p>
               <p>The MSAA State of a DataGrid is a combination of:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <code>STATE_SYSTEM_UNAVAILABLE</code> (when <code>enabled</code> is
  <code>false</code>)</li>
                  <li>
                     <code>STATE_SYSTEM_FOCUSABLE</code> (when <code>enabled</code> is
  <code>true</code>)</li>
                  <li>
                     <code>STATE_SYSTEM_FOCUSED</code> (when <code>enabled</code> is
  <code>true</code> and the DataGrid has focus)</li>
                  <li>
                     <code>STATE_SYSTEM_MULTISELECTABLE</code> (when
  <code>allowMultipleSelection</code> is true)</li>
               </ul>
               <p>The State of a data row or cell is a combination of:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <code>STATE_SYSTEM_FOCUSABLE</code>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <code>STATE_SYSTEM_FOCUSED</code> (when focused)</li>
                  <li>
                     <code>STATE_SYSTEM_OFFSCREEN</code> (when the row or cell has
  scrolled offscreen)</li>
                  <li>
                     <code>STATE_SYSTEM_SELECTABLE</code>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <code>STATE_SYSTEM_SELECTED</code> (when it is selected)</li>
               </ul>
               <p>The State of a header cell is <code>STATE_SYSTEM_NORMAL</code>, since
  header cells may not receive focus or be selected.  As currently
  implemented, header cells may not report
  <code>STATE_SYSTEM_OFFSCREEN</code> even if the grid itself is moved such
  that its headers are offscreen.</p>
               <p>When the State of the DataGrid or one of its items changes, a DataGrid
  dispatches the MSAA event <code>EVENT_OBJECT_STATECHANGE</code> with the
  proper childID for the row or cell or 0 for itself.</p>
               <p>This property is not handled by the DataGrid accessibility
  implementation for item editors as item editors manage themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <b>Value</b>
               </p>
               <p>DataGrids and their children (rows, cells, and headers) do not have
  MSAA Values.</p>
               <p>
                  <b>Location</b>
               </p>
               <p>The MSAA Location of a DataGrid or a row, data cell, or header cell
  within it is its bounding rectangle.  The Location of an item that is
  currently not displayed on screen is undefined.</p>
               <p>This property is not handled by the DataGrid accessibility
  implementation for item editors as item editors manage themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <b>Default Action</b>
               </p>
               <p>A DataGrid does not have an MSAA DefaultAction. The MSAA DefaultAction
  for a row or cell is "Double Click" and for a header cell is "Click," and
  the corresponding localized string will be returned when the default
  action string is requested.</p>
               <p>Performing the default action on a data row or cell will cause it to
  be focused and selected and may cause other behavior depending on
  cell/row type.  Performing the default action on a header will cause the
  grid to be sorted by that column.  Repeated default actions on the header
  will toggle the sort order between ascending and descending.  At this
  writing, there is no way via the AccImpl to arrange for a multilevel sort
  on several columns at once.</p>
               <p>This property is not handled by the DataGrid accessibility
  implementation for item editors as item editors manage themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <b>Focus</b>
               </p>
               <p>When there is no specific item (row or cell depending on selection
  mode) in focus within the grid, Focus returns 0 indicating that the grid
  itself has focus.  This should only happen when the grid contains no
  data.</p>
               <p>When a row (row selection mode) or cell (cell selection mode) has
  focus, Focus returns the childID of the focused item.</p>
               <p>When a DataGrid receives focus, it dispatches the MSAA event
  <code>EVENT_OBJECT_FOCUS</code>.  This event is also dispatched when
  focus moves among rows or cells within the grid.</p>
               <p>A focus change event is fired on the item editor when it
  starts/appears.  A focus change event is fired on the DataGrid when the
  item editor is saved or closed.</p>
               <p>
                  <b>Selection</b>
               </p>
               <p>A DataGrid allows either a single row or cell or multiple rows or
  cells to be selected, depending on the
  <code>allowMultipleSelection</code> property.  Selection returns an array
  of the integer childIDs of the selected items.</p>
               <p>When an item is selected exclusively, it dispatches MSAA event
  <code>EVENT_OBJECT_SELECTION</code>.  When a cell (cell selection mode)
  or row (row selection mode) is added to the current set of selections,
  the dispatched event is <code>EVENT_OBJECT_SELECTIONADD</code>.
  Similarly, if an item (cell or row) is removed from selection, the
  dispatched event is <code>EVENT_OBJECT_SELECTIONREMOVE</code>.  If all
  selections are cleared (regardless of how many items were selected) or a
  select-all or select-region action is performed, the dispatched event is
  <code>EVENT_OBJECT_SELECTIONWITHIN</code>.  Any selection operation not
  matching one of those listed above will dispatch
  <code>EVENT_OBJECT_SELECTION</code>.</p>
               <p>This property is not handled by the DataGrid accessibility
  implementation for item editors as item editors manage themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <b>Select</b>
               </p>
               <p>The <code>accSelect</code> method implements requests made via MSAA
  for changes in selection and/or focus within the DataGrid.  The AccImpl
  for the DataGrid supports the setting of focus to a DataGrid itself or to
  a data item or set of items (row or cell depending on selection mode)
  within it.  Supported actions include setting focus, exclusively
  selecting one item, and adding and removing an item or set of items from
  selection, all as defined in the Microsoft Active Accessibility
  specification.  At this writing, attempting to use <code>accSelect</code>
  to extend an already-selected multi-cell region in cell multiselection
  mode to include more rows and columns at once may yield different results
  than doing the same action with a mouse.</p>

      Enables accessibility in the DataGrid class.
           <p>This method is called by application startup code
      that is autogenerated by the MXML compiler.
      Afterwards, when instances of DataGrid are initialized,
      their <code>accessibilityImplementation</code> property
      will be set to an instance of this class.</p>
