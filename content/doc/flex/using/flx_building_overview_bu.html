            <p>You must be familiar with the ways to configure your development
environment. Flex Software Development Kit (SDK) primarily provide
XML files that you use to configure the settings. The flex-config.xml
file defines the default compiler options for the compilers.</p>

            <p>In addition to server and compiler configuration settings, you
can also modify the messaging and data management settings, the
JVM heap size, Adobe<sup>®</sup> Flash<sup>®</sup> Player
settings, and logging and caching settings. </p>

            <p>
               Flex includes
application compilers and component compilers. You use the application
compilers to compile SWF files from MXML and other source files.
You use the component compilers to compile SWC files from component
files. You can then use SWC files as dynamic or static libraries
with your Flex applications.</p>

            <p>The application compilers take the following forms:</p>

            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>mxmlc command-line compiler. You launch the mxlmc compiler
from the command line to create a SWF file that you then deploy
to a website.</p>

               </li>

               <li>
                  <p>fcsh compiler shell. Provides an optimized environment for
using the mxmlc command-line compiler. For more information, see <a href="flx_compilers_cpl.html#WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf67670-7fcd_verapache">Using
fcsh, the Flex compiler shell</a>.</p>

               </li>

            </ul>

            <p>The component compilers take the following form:</p>

            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>compc command-line compiler. You open the compc compiler
from the command line to create SWC files. You can use these SWC
files as static component libraries, themes, or runtime shared libraries
(RSLs).</p>

               </li>

            </ul>

         <div>
            <p>
               To test
your applications, you run the application SWF files in a web browser
or the stand-alone Flash Player. If you encounter errors in your
applications, you can use the debugging tools to set and manage
breakpoints in your code; control application execution by suspending,
resuming, and terminating the application; step into and over the
code statements; select critical variables to watch; evaluate watch
expressions while the application is running; and so on.</p>

            <p>Flex provides the following debugging tools:</p>

            <dl>
               
                  <dt class="dlterm">The fdb command-line debugger</dt>

                     <p>The fdb command-line debugger provides a command-line interface
to the debugging experience. With fdb, you can step into code, add
breakpoints, and check variables. For more information,

            Flex applications can use many types
of application files such as classes, component libraries, theme
files, and Runtime Shared Libraries (RSLs).</p>

         <div>
            <p>You can use any number of component classes in your Flex
applications. These classes can be MXML or ActionScript files. You
can use classes to extend existing components or define new ones. </p>

            <p>Component classes can take the form of MXML, ActionScript files,
or as SWC files. In MXML or ActionScript files, the components are
not compiled but reside in a directory structure that is part of
your compiler’s source path. SWC files are described in <a href="flx_building_overview_bu.html#WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7fd4_verapache">SWC
files</a>.</p>

            <p>Component libraries are not dynamically linked unless they are
used in a Runtime Shared Library (RSL). Component classes are statically
linked at compile time, which means that they must be in the compiler’s
source path. For information about creating and using custom component
classes, see <a href="flx_createcomps_intro_cci.html#WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf68268-8000_verapache">Custom

         <h3 class="topictitle3">SWC files</h3>

         
         <div>
            <p>
               A <em>SWC</em> file
is an archive file for Flex components and other assets. SWC files contain
a SWF file and a catalog.xml file. The SWF file inside the SWC file
implements the compiled component or group of components and includes embedded
resources as symbols. Flex applications extract the SWF file from
a SWC file, and use the SWF file’s contents when the application
refers to resources in that SWC file. The catalog.xml file lists
of the contents of the component package and its individual components.</p>

            <p>You compile SWC files by using the component compiler, compc.
SWC files can be component libraries, RSLs, theme files, and resource
bundles. </p>

            <p>To include a SWC file in your application at compile time, it
must be located in the library path. For more information about
SWC files, see <a href="flx_compilers_cpl.html#WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7fd3_verapache">About

            <h4 class="topictitle4">Component libraries</h4>

            
            <div>
               <p>
                  A component
library is a SWC file that contains classes and other assets that
your Flex application uses. The component library’s file structure
defines the package system that the components are in. </p>

               <p>Typically, component libraries are statically linked into your
application, which means that the compiler compiles it into the
SWF file before the user downloads that file.</p>

               <p>To build a component library SWC file, you use the <samp class="codeph">include-classes</samp>, <samp class="codeph">include-namespaces</samp>,
and <samp class="codeph">include-sources</samp> component compiler options.
For more information on building component libraries, see <a href="flx_compilers_cpl.html#WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7fd2_verapache">Using compc,

            <h4 class="topictitle4">Runtime Shared Libraries</h4>

            
            <div>
               <p>
                  You can use
shared assets that can be separately downloaded and cached on the client
in Flex. These shared assets are loaded by multiple applications
at run time, but must be transferred only once to the client. These
shared files are known as <em>Runtime Shared Libraries</em> or <em>RSLs</em>.</p>

               <p>RSLs are the only kind of application asset that is dynamically
linked into your Flex application. When you compile your application,
the RSL source files must be available to the compiler so that it
can perform proper link checking. The assets themselves are not
included in the application SWF file, but are only referenced at
run time.</p>

               <p>To create an RSL SWC file, you add files to a library by using
the <samp class="codeph">include-classes</samp> and <samp class="codeph">include-namespaces</samp> component
compiler options. To use RSLs when compiling your application, you
use the <samp class="codeph">external-library-path</samp>, <samp class="codeph">externs</samp>, <samp class="codeph">load-externs</samp>,
and <samp class="codeph">runtime-shared-libraries</samp> application compiler
options. The <samp class="codeph">external-library-path</samp>, <samp class="codeph">externs</samp>,
and <samp class="codeph">load-externs</samp> options provide the compile-time
location of the libraries. The <samp class="codeph">runtime-shared-libraries</samp> option
provides the run-time location of the shared library. The compiler
requires this for dynamic linking.</p>

                  A <em>theme </em>defines
the look and feel of a Flex application. A theme can define something
as simple as the color scheme or common font for an application,
or it can be a complete reskinning of all the components used by
the application. </p>

               <p>Themes usually take the form of a SWC file. However, themes can
also be composed of a CSS file and embedded graphical resources,
such as symbols from a SWF file.</p>

               <p>Theme files must be available to the compiler at compile-time.
You build a theme file by using the <samp class="codeph">include-file</samp> and <samp class="codeph">include-classes</samp> component compiler
options to add skin files and style sheets to a SWC file. You then reference
the theme SWC file when you compile the main Flex application by using
the <samp class="codeph">theme</samp> application compiler option.</p>

               <p>For more information about themes, see <a href="flx_styles_st.html#WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7f85_verapache">About

         <div>
            <p>
               Other application
assets include images, fonts, movies, and sound files. You can embed
these assets at compile time or access them at run time.</p>

            <p>When you embed an asset, you compile it into your application’s
SWF file. The advantage of embedding an asset is that it is included
in the SWF file, and can be accessed faster than when the application
has to load it from a remote location at run time. The disadvantage
of embedding an asset is that your SWF file is larger than if you
load the resource at run time. </p>

            <p>The alternative to embedding an asset is to load the asset at
run time. You can load an asset from the local file system in which
the SWF file runs, or you can access a remote asset, typically though
an HTTP request over a network.</p>

            <p>Embedded assets load immediately, because they are already part
of the Flex SWF file. However, they add to the size of your application
and slow down the application initialization process. Embedded assets
also require you to recompile your applications whenever your asset
files change.</p>

            <p>For more information, see <a href="flx_embed_em.html#WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7fce_verapache">Embedding
