<p>"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on

perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,

license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against
any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the
date such litigation is filed.</p>
<p><strong><a name="redistribution">4. Redistribution</a></strong>. You may reproduce and
distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium,
with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that

<ol>
<li>
<p>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
copy of this License; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
that You changed the files; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
any part of the Derivative Works; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy
of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding
those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in
at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,
if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated
by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally
appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only
and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to
the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution
notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
this License.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><a name="contributions">5. Submission of Contributions</a></strong>. Unless You
explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the
terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor
regarding such Contributions.</p>
<p><strong><a name="trademarks">6. Trademarks</a></strong>. This License does not grant
permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product
names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use
in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the
NOTICE file.</p>
<p><strong><a name="no-warranty">7. Disclaimer of Warranty</a></strong>. Unless required by
applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and
each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including,
without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You
are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise
of permissions under this License.</p>
<p><strong><a name="no-liability">8. Limitation of Liability</a></strong>. In no event and
under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result
of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including
but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses),
even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.</p>
<p><strong><a name="additional">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability</a></strong>.
While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf
and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
liability.</p>
